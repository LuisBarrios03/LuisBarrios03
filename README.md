Hi, I'm Luis Barrios and I'm a fifth year computer science student, this subject is my greatest passion but despite I love all its facets I prefer programming and coding and it is precisely these topics that we are going to deal with in this channel!
Even if I think I'm a "novice" I get along with different programming languages: C #, Java, Html, Css, Javascript, Jquery, Python3, Json, Ajax.
Through my tutorials I hope to remove all your doubts regarding the world of programming, subscribe to the channel and leave a like to support me and not to miss any video!
A greeting!
Luis
